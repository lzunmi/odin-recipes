    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Goguma latte, also known as sweet potato latte, is popular korean drink. It's made by blending roasted or steamed sweet potatoes with milk and a bit of sweetness. I know you might think of coffe as soon as you read latte, but this is not the case since goguma latte does not include coffe in it's ingridients. It can be served in boths ways, warm and chilled.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients.</h2>

        <li>Shaved almonds - take this as an optional topping ingridient.</li>
